## React Basic E-Commerce App

This file is the starting point for the React Basic E-Commerce App. This project is a simple e-commerce app that displays a list of products and allows users to add them to a shopping cart. It also includes a filtering feature that allows users to filter products by search term.

Use the following endpoint to fetch the products data:
“https://random-data-api.com/api/commerce/random_commerce?size=10”
